    "text": "1 Introduction to the OBIS contribution to MPA Europe\nThe EU Horizon project “Marine Protected Areas Europe (MPA Europe, https://mpa-europe.eu) aims to identify the locations within the European seas where MPAs would protect the highest number of species, habitats and ecosystems. This information is crucial to establish a functional MPA network and will help managers to propose further areas for conservation in the future. Innovative and bold, MPA Europe will also go one step further by considering the potential blue carbon benefits of the prioritization.\nOBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) will contribute with three pieces of information which will be supplied to the area prioritization process: (i) species distribution models (SDMs) of at least half of the European marine species; (ii) diversity metrics for European seas; and (iii) habitat maps considering habitat forming species. In all cases, models will be created using OBIS data and will include predictions for future scenarios according to CMIP6."

    "text": "3.1 Selecting species for modeling\nThe first step was to establish the species occurring on the study area. We used the robis function dataset to retrieve all species occurring on the study area. Further on we filtered the dataset to:\n\nretain only taxa at the species level\nretain only taxa with accepted taxonomic status\nremove Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi and Protozoa taxa\ninclude only marine or brackish species\n\nFrom that we obtained a final list of 27112 species."

Thus, for each combination of GeoHash cell and year, only one record was kept. That part is implemented in the mp_dup_check function, of the project package msdm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe note that, specifically for the SDMs, before modeling we do an additional duplicate removal in order to keep only a single record per cell.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Remove records on land\nRecords on land were removed based on [TODO - see if use GHRSS or openmap].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe further filtered the records for the SDMs by keeping only those overlapping the environmental variable layers (which present some differences to the land layer used before).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Geographical outliers (flagging)\nThe novelty of our approach is that for computing the distance between points we considered the existence of barriers. This is specially important for marine species. So for example, the distance between a point on the Pacific side of the Panama strait, and on the Atlantic side, would be XXX when considering only the cartesian distance. However, when we consider the barrier, the distance is of XXX.\n\n\n3.3.4 Environmental outliers (flagging)"
